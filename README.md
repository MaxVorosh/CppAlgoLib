# About
This repo is an attempt to create lib for algorithmic structures. It cannot cover all of their usage due to variety of problems they can solve. But this lib can help with some simple tasks.
# Usage
For usage you can just download corresponded header file. E.g. if you want to use segment tree, you should just download segment_tree.h and include it where it's necessary.
# Content
For now, only segment tree is available. In future there are going to be other structures, like graphs.
